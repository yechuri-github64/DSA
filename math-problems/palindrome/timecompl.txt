d = number of digits

--------------------------------
APPROACH 1: FULL REVERSE (PURE MATH)
--------------------------------
Logic:
- Reverse the entire number using modulo and division
- Compare reversed number with original

Loop:
- Loop runs d times (one iteration per digit)

Time Complexity:
- O(d)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)

--------------------------------
APPROACH 2: HALF REVERSE (OPTIMIZED)
--------------------------------
Logic:
- Reverse only half of the digits
- Stop when reversed number >= remaining number
- Compare both halves

Loop:
- Loop runs approximately d/2 times

Time Complexity:
- O(d)   (since d/2 → O(d))

Space Complexity:
- O(1)
